        <h3>Not So Berry</h3>
        <hr />
        <h5>Rules</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Each heir must represent the color of the generation (i.e. hair,
            makeup, clothing), but brightly colored skin is not necessary (these
            aren&rsquo;t actually berry Sims, that&rsquo;s the joke). Of course,
            this is optional but a big portion of the fun.
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            The colors of the spouses don&rsquo;t matter as they aren&rsquo;t
            part of the challenge. Unless otherwise stated you can do whatever
            you please with them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Money cheats can be used, but not excessively. Suggestion: use
            freerealestate for your first home, but no cheats afterward.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may live wherever you please unless something is specified in
            the rules of a generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every generation is supposed to complete both the career and
            aspiration of the heir unless explicitly stated otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>Keep the lifespan on normal.</li>

        <h5>Generation Two: Rose</h5>
        <p>
          You had everything you desired as a child but you were always longing
          for more. If we had a workaholic trait in The Sims 4, you would have
          it. After a long day at work, you like to unwind with yoga and
          meditation. As an adult, your top priority becomes finding your
          soulmate to share your life with. You have absolutely no maternal
          instincts whatsoever but you still love your child with all your
          heart.

          Growing up you never had a close relationship with your mother and
          spent the majority of your time alone in your room obsessing over the

          You always felt that you were different. While the rest of your family
          was busy playing around in the ocean, you just wanted to be having
          social gatherings with your friends. However, you do not enjoy
          cleaning up after these parties so you need to find a husband that is
          willing to clean up after you. To make up for your nonexistent
          relationship with your parents you want to be there for your own
          children as much as possible&hellip;you also love filling your home
          with family photos.

        <p>
          You&rsquo;ve always been good at anything you tried. It&rsquo;s been
          hard to choose a career you like so you try a whole bunch! The one
          thing that&rsquo;s been consistent in your life is your love and
          fascination for Selvadoradian culture. You also like to move often and
          have a hard time deciding if your spouse is really&nbsp;&ldquo;the
          one&rdquo;. Basically: you&rsquo;re an indecisive oddball.

          afraid to quit your steady job to follow your dreams. You&rsquo;re
          very practical and you know the chances of making it as a florist are
          slim, so you stay working at your nine to five. As an adult you
          finally decide to pursue your dreams. You&rsquo;re a hopeless

          love.

        <p>
          You have the perfect life. White picket fence, loving spouse,
          beautiful children. But why do you still want more? It&rsquo;s not so
          much the fame, but the feeling of being on the big screen that
          you&rsquo;re after! You have a one time secret affair and will regret
          it for the rest of your life. You love being a parent and a
          hard-working actor and you&rsquo;re DETERMINED to do both
          wholeheartedly.
