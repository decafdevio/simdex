          Your family was always into the farming deal. They spent their days
          working hard and asked their children to do the same. When you turned
          18, your parents surprised you with your own plot of land to continue
          on tradition. Having always been one to want to impress the folks, you
          began creating your own garden; you'd rather dedicate your life to
          that than a dreadful 9 to 5 suit and tie anyway.
