          <li>Sim lifespan must be set to normal.</li>
          <li>
            The player may play other households in the same file, but they must
            make sure the matriarch's household is not aging.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any mods or CC that give the player an unfair advantage over other
            players are not allowed (e.g. a mod that allows the player to have
            more than eight Sims in a household).
          </li>
          <li>
            Any cheats that give the player an unfair advantage over other
            players are not allowed. In the case of a glitch or game crash that
            corrupts the save file, the player is always allowed to use any
            means necessary to retrieve what was lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            The challenge ends as soon as the 100
            <sup>th</sup>
            child is born.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any rewards or in-game methods of extending a Sim's lifespan, saving
            a Sim from death or bringing a Sim back from the dead are not
            allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dead Sims who turned to ghosts cannot be moved back into the active
            household.
          </li>
          <li>
            Babies cannot be aged up until the player gets a notification saying
            that it is their birthday.
          </li>
          <li>
            Toddlers can be aged up when they reach level three in all of their
            toddler skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            Children and teens can be aged up after they get an A in school.
          </li>
          <li>
            Young adults can be moved out of the house to make room for more
            children but they cannot be moved back in.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the matriarch becomes an elder and can no longer bear children,
            her youngest daughter takes over as the next matriarch. The player
            must keep the predecessor in the household until the heir becomes a
            young adult.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player cannot make more room in the house faster by killing off
            underage Sims or letting babies, toddlers or children be taken by
            social services. Moreover, a child born into the household will not
            count towards the 100 baby count unless they age up to a young
            adult.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch cannot join any career track that requires the Sim to
            leave the lot because she needs to focus on her children. However,
            teenagers in the household may join a part-time job to help bring
            extra income.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hiring NPC's is allowed, except caterers which can be used to get
            the matriarch out of feeding their own children and nannies which
            can be used to get the matriarch out of taking care of children's
            needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch may not get engaged or married while she is of
            child-bearing age.
          </li>
          <li>The matriarch may not get pregnant by the same donor twice.</li>
          <li>
            None of the donors can move into the household or provide any aid in
            taking care of the children. Using the child support feature in
            deaderpool's MC Command Center mod is not allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the player can adopt children without penalty, adopted
            children are negligible towards the baby count.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch is not allowed to influence the gender of her baby in
            any way (e.g. eating strawberries and carrots and listening to
            alternative and pop music).
          </li>
          <li>
            Children's traits and aspirations must be randomized and cannot be

        <p>
          The following lists the additional rules for expansion packs. This is
          only applicable if the expansion pack in question is installed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the player is moving into a lot without any lot traits, the
            player may choose the traits, but they cannot be changed after. If
            the player moves into a lot that already has at least one lot trait
            assigned to it, the player cannot add or change them.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the matriarch joins semi-active careers, she must always choose
            to work from home.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch may have her own pets, although each pet will take up
            one household slot.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch can go on vacations but she must always bring her
            entire household with her when she goes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player has the Parenthood pack, teens must have at least one
            character value within trait range (either positive or negative).
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch must always stop what she is doing to discipline the
            toddlers' or children's bad behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch must always choose one of the available options on the
            teaching moment prompt.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch may use the wishing well, but she cannot wish for a
            child.
          </li>
          <li>
            The matriarch may hire a butler only if deaderpools's MC Command
            Center mod is installed, so the player can disable child care in the
            butler options.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Any occult children and teenagers in the household must be in their
            normal Sim disguise when they leave the lot. If a non-occult townie
            discovers that one of the active household's Sims is an occult,
            their memory must be wiped immediately. Furthermore, all the members
            of the active household is no longer allowed to interact with the
            Sim in question.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each occult or hybrid occult child born to the matriarch adds two to
            the player total child count.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player chooses the heir to be an alien or a hybrid, the
            player forfeits the two-child-count bonus.
